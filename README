Skittish is a tree that has (relatively) normal behaviors in a quiet atmosphere. As soon as someone makes noise, it goes away of its nature and starts behaving like an skittish animal. For example if one screams at it really loud, it will shake violently and drop all of its leaves. It would go running if it could.
